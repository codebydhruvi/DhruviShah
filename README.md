# DhruviShah
As a Post Graduate in Economics and a Research Intern at RBI, I possess a strong analytical skillset and a passion for working with economic data. I have found a unique way to combine my love for economics with programming and am always looking for like-minded individuals to connect with. Feel free to explore my GitHub page to see examples of my work and connect with me to collaborate on projects that merge economics and programming.
